console.log("Calling a function prior to definition...", works());
console.log("But assigning a function expression to a variable and then calling the variable before the definition...", didNotWork());

function works() {
return "success";
}

sub = function didNotWork() {
return "success";
}

 

 

Output:(using node.js in windows command prompt)

Calling a function prior to definition... success

ReferenceError: sub is not defined

 

**Note: I omitted extra code regarding my windows directories. 

Observation: When I removed the "sub = function..." the function worked appropriately. This demonstrates that function hoisting does not work when the function definition is hidden by assignment to a variable.
